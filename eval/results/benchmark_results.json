After it\u2019s confirmed, you\u2019ll be pooled and you can switch pools later.\n\nGUI (wallet)\n- Open your wallet, click the Pooling icon, then JOIN A POOL.\n- Choose Connect to pool.\n- Enter a valid pool URL (e.g., from chialinks.com). You can look up pools there.\n- Confirm to create the Plot NFT (this costs one mojo; you may also add a blockchain fee). It may take several minutes to confirm.\n- You can change pools later using the Plot NFT.\n\nCLI\n- Run: chia plotnft create -s pool -u https://<pool_url>\n- After creation, wait for it to be confirmed in the Pools tab. You only need 1 plot NFT.\n- You can join a pool later or switch pools at any time.\n\nNotes\n- The pool URL must start with https://.\n- The pool contract address appears in some outputs and begins with \u201cxch\u201d (contextual detail; not required to join).",

The Farm panel shows Farm Health information to help you assess status at a glance.\n\nIn short: run chia farm summary to verify \u201cFarming status: Farming\u201d; if you need more detail, switch logs to INFO and inspect the log file, or use the GUI Farm panel for a visual health overview.",

Your plots should be associated with the same NFT (this helps with farming to a pool and changing pools later).\n- In the plot creation wizard:\n  - Keys: typically you don\u2019t need to change these; they are the keys you set up previously.\n  - Choose a K value and a compression level. Depending on your plotter, you may need to select one or the other. If a Compression Level dropdown appears, you can choose 3 for a modest level of compression.\n  - Select a temporary storage location if prompted by your plotter. Some plots can be created entirely in RAM (RAM plots) and others require temporary storage on disk.\n  - Final directory: choose where the completed plot will be copied after creation (most farmers use an HDD for this).\n  - Number of plots: set this to 1 for your first plot.\n- Click CREATE. You\u2019ll be taken to a progress panel that shows the plotting progress.\n- Optional: If you want to experiment later, you can try different settings. Compressed plots (level 3) are generally faster to harvest, while a C0 (uncompressed) plot is fine for getting started.\n- If you\u2019re using RAM plots, note that they require a lot of memory (roughly 256 GB\u2013416 GB, depending on the plotter).\n\nThat\u2019s the basic flow for creating your first plot.",

Close all Chia applications on your computer.\n  - Check firewall or antivirus software that might be blocking connections.\n\n- Clear potential peer data issues\n  - Delete the peer database: remove ~/.chia/mainnet/db/peer_table_node.sqlite\n  - Close then restart Chia.\n\n- Adjust syncing timeout\n  - Edit ~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml and increase weight_proof_timeout from 180 to 400. If the setting isn\u2019t there, add it under the full_node section.\n\n- Force a refresh\n  - Use Force Reload (top menu bar \u2192 Force Reload). This may help get things syncing again after waiting 5\u201310 minutes.\n\n- Verify sync status\n  - You can check if you are synced by looking for a synced message in the wallet (top right) or on the Full Node tab.\n  - The Peak Height should closely match that of your peers. You can also confirm against a well-synced block explorer.\n\n- If you\u2019re still not syncing\n  - You have two options:\n    - Sync from genesis (the most secure option, but it will take a long time\u2014days to possibly a week or more depending on speed and peers).\n    - Download a checkpoint database (faster, but requires trusting the checkpoint data).\n\n- If you see blocks and connections but still Not Synced\n  - Try the above steps in order (check port, UPnP, firewall, restart after clearing peer DB, adjust weight_proof_timeout, force reload, and verify sync status). If issues persist, consider switching to a checkpoint-based sync or starting from genesis as described above.",

If log_level was not INFO, change it to INFO to get more detail.\n\n- Check that your plots are passing the filter\n  - There are steps in the docs to verify plots are passing the filter; this is a useful sanity check to rule out plot-related issues.\n\n- Check GUI/CLI health\n  - GUI users can use the Farm and Harvest panels (2.0) to get an overview of farm health. Look at the Farm panel and Farm Health interpretation for clues.\n  - If you\u2019re using the CLI, review the farm health/status output as described above.\n\n- Consider pool farming\n  - Joining a pool can help provide partial rewards that confirm your farm is reachable and sized correctly, even if you\u2019re not currently winning solo rewards.\n\n- Look at normal vs. abnormal log information\n  - The docs show examples of normal INFO log lines (e.g., from full_node and farmer). If you see errors or unusual messages in the logs, that may indicate a problem needing investigation.\n\nIf you can share the exact symptoms or any error messages (e.g., the output of chia farm summary or any log lines from log/debug.log), I can help interpret them.",
